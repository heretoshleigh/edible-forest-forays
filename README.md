This dark and moody, responsive website was a blast to build for a mushroom foraging business.

### Tech used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I also designed the logo for this company, deployed as an SVG.

### Optimizations:
This site has been optimized for both mobile and desktop performance, as well as accessibility, general best practices, and SEO. Because this is an image-heavy site, progressive rendering techniques and proper image sizing were essential to performance gains.
